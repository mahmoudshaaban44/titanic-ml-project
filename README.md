# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the Titanic dataset, perform data preprocessing, build classification models, and evaluate their performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Results
The best model achieved an accuracy of over **80%** in predicting passenger survival.

## How to Run the Project
